# Basic concept

number = [1, 3, 4, 5, 345,"saroj",bool, 566,]

print(number[5])

number[5] = "kumar" # so list is mutable

print(number[5])
print(number[0:6]) # so list list is also slicing

number.append("Bos")  # append function is add the new data at the end 

print(number)

number1 = [1,2,343,345,45,56,4,] #list of number

number1.sort() # this function is design the list in ascending order
print(number1)

number1.reverse() # this function reverse the list
print(number1)

number1.remove(4)
print(number1)
